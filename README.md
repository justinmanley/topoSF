3D model of San Francisco
=========================

To generate a topographical model of San Francisco, run at the command line:

```
git clone http://github.com/justinmanley/topoSF
cd topoSF
make
```

You will have to complete the last two steps manually - there are instructions
in the Makefile.

Here's what you'll get once you've finished those last two steps:

Have fun!
